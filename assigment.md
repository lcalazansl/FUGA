# Assignment
Create an app in Ruby that parses XML and outputs the processed data.

- Project has to be uploaded to GitHub/GitLab
- Readme with instructions on how to run the app is required
- XML data and structure is up to you
- Output type is also up to you, can be "puts" in terminal,  JSON saved in a new file, whatever seems appropriate.
- Treat the output as if eventually it will be sent as a body of an API request to another service
- Please treat it as a feature that will be iterated upon in future, and will have to be maintained by your team members. Provide as much documentation as you deem necessary (your thought process behind the architecture, the scope you ended up with, possible enhancements, etc.)
